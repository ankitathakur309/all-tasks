    <p style="font-size:30px;">I Ankita am a 2nd year computer science student of MCE Motihari </p>
    <p>I am an Engineering student but it is just my backup plan. Actually my passion is to do public services and I want to be a civil servant. I want to share something about my goal.</p>
<p>Human life is full of hard work and struggle. Similar is the case with me, there is a lot of competition and success rate is very low, almost o.1% in civil services examination and because of that I choose to do Engineering from computer sceince but my dream is not to be an engineer , I just want to be a civil seavant and it is not my goal but is my childhood dream which I want to achieve as soon as posssible. But continueing both these prepration together is becoming very difficult for me.Sometimes there is a lot of pressure of college exams, Internship, Projects etc and together with these pressures mentaining consistency in my goal's prepration becomes very challenging factor for me but at that time I motivate myself by remembering the lifestory of successful persons of this world.</p>
